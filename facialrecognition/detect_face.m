% Tolga Birdal's original code is heavily modified by Md. Iftekhar Tanveer
% (go2chayan@gmail.com)
% Modifications by Md. Iftekhar Tanveer:
% code optimized for the following assumptions:
% 1. Only one face in scene and it is the primary object
% 2. Faster noise reducion and face detection

% Originaly by Tolga Birdal
% Implementation of the paper:
% "A simple and accurate face detection algorithm in complex background"
% by Yu-Tang Pai, Shanq-Jang Ruan, Mon-Chau Shie, Yi-Chi Liu

% Additions by Tolga Birdal:
%  Minimum face size constraint
%  Adaptive theta thresholding (Theta is thresholded by mean2(theata)/4
%  Parameters are modified by to detect better. Please check the paper for
%  parameters they propose.
% Check the paper for more details.

% usage:
%  I=double(imread('c:\Data\girl1.jpg'));
%  detect_face(I);
% The function will display the bounding box if a face is found.
